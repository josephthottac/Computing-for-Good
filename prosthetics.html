            <h3>What are the impacts of amputation?</h3>
            <p>An amputation is a permanent disfigurement. For some, the relief from pain or disease in the affected limb may be welcome, but, for those losing a sound limb, resentment is understandable. Despite modern prosthetics, some adaptation is required, and people vary in their ability to adjust to the change in body image and, sometimes, lifestyle.</p>
            <h3>How have prosthetics progressed?</h3>
            <p>Prosthetic technology has advanced to a remarkable degree in the past two decades, driven largely by amputees' demand. Today, otherwise healthy individuals with mid-calf amputation should be able to participate in a full range of normal responsibilities, to walk without any perceptible limp, and to engage in recreational and sports activities.</p>

            <h3>How has technology impacted this field?</h3>
            <p>Star Wars fans will remember Luke Skywalker’s bionic hand responding to the probes of a medical robot in The Empire Strikes Back, a scene that left many viewers wondering when science fiction might become reality. Now, more than 37 years after that scene was shot, researchers at the University of Utah—using a DARPA-funded prosthetic arm named, you guessed it, the LUKE—have figured out a way to restore more than 100 sensations to amputees. By implanting a device into a person’s residual nerves, as well as electrodes placed in muscles, the researchers have created an information loop that is then transferred into signals that the brain recognizes as sensations of touch.</p>

          <h2>Future of Prosthetics</h2>
          <p>Initially, prosthetic innovations are often used sparingly, primarily by amputees with private funding—particularly those who are competitive athletes. As experience is gained, manufacturers discover how to apply the same principles to moderate cost devices intended for less active individuals, and the performance of prostheses in general will gradually improve as a result.</p>
          <p>Similarly, some of the newer materials and applications will be used for the benefit of amputees in developing countries, despite differences in the cause of amputation and people's needs. It is really financial constraints that limit the rate of advancement in prosthetic rehabilitation, and one of the greatest challenges for the new millennium will be to find the will and the way to fund widespread application of prosthetic innovations.</p>

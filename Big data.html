        <h1> <u> Use of big data in improving the healthcare system </u> </h1>

<h3> What is big data? </h3>
<p> Big data is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/big-data"> "â€‹sets of information that are too large or too complex to handle, analyse or use with standard methods". </a>

<h3>How is big data used in the healthcare sector? </h3>
<p>Big data is used to collect and analyse large quantities of data that are too vast or complex to be understood using traditional means of data processing. Instead, big data uses machine learning algorithims to analyse the data, which is understood by data scientists. Big data has four attributes that define it: volume, variety, velocity and veracity.</p>
<p> <b> Volume: </b> the most important characteristic of big data, being able to handle huge amounts of data makes the use of big data in healthcare more useful than the use of humans in collecting and genrating data. </p>
<p> <b> Variety: </b> as technology has advanced, variety has been an interesting development. Paticulary unstructured data.</p>
<p> <b> Veracity: </b> the trustworthiness of the data. Veracity refers to the bias, noise and abnormalities in data. </p>
<p> <b> Velocity: </b> refers to the speed in which incoming data can be processed. </p>

<h2> Ways in which big data is being used in healthcare today: </h2>

<ul>

<li> <h3> Electronic health records (EHRs) </h3>
<img src="resources/ehr.jpg" alt="precription image" width="300" height="200">
<p> Health records for patient's have now become digital throughout the UK. Each person has a digital record which includes their medical history, allergies and test results. Very beneficial for use by doctors and pharmacists, the electronic records track prescriptions, record prescribed medication and alert when a patient needs a review or lab test. <p>
<p> The use of EHRs prevents doctors prescribing or pharmacists dispensing medication which could interact with other medication the patient is taking. They also allow for doctors and pharmacists to view the patient's medical history, allowing them to make quicker and more informed decisions. </p> 
<p> The variety of data in EHRs, including the huge demographic of various ages, races and health issues.These medical records minimise paperwork, reducing the work of medical proffessionals and lab tests. </p> </li>

<li> <h3> Patient management </h3>
<img src="resources/blood_pressure.jpg" alt="blood pressure image" width="300" height="200">
<p> The increase in the IoT (Internet of Things) and smart devices have created an area for healthcare devices which allow patient's to self monitor and manage their own health. </p>
<p> Examples of this include: wearable devices for heart rate, blood pressure and diabetic glucose monitors.<p>
<p> The use of devices for self monitoring give greater control to patients, this frees up appointments for doctors and can prevent hospital stays as the patient will detect changes before they become serious. <p> </li>

<li> <h3> Predictive analytics </h3>
<img src="resources/analytics.jpg" alt="analytics image" width="300" height="200">
<p> The use of predicitve analytics in healthcare is beneficial in many ways, from predicting disease outbreaks, admission rates to hospital and the accuracy of diagnosis.</p>
<p> Additionally, big data is helping in early detection, which allows for earlier and better treatment. This in turn can reduce life-shortening consequences. </p>
<p> Predictive analytics in big data also enable doctors to identify patients at a higher risk of opioid abuse and opiod-related death. Through early detection in identifying risk factors, doctors can work in reversing this. </p> </li>

<li> <h3> Medical Imaging </h3>
<img src="resources/medical_imaging.jpg" alt="medical image photo" width="300" height="200">
<p> Big data can analyse large numbers of medical images quicker than humans, saving both time and money. </p>
<p> Medical imaging includes: radiography (x-rays), x-ray computed Tomography (CT scans), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI scans) and Ultrasounds. </p>
<p> Applying big data to medical imaging increases efficiency and reduced both the possibility of errors and the need for manual imput. </p> </li>

<li> <h3> Preventing human errors </h3>
<img src="resources/error.jpg" alt="error image" width="300" height="200">
<p> The use of big data in healthcare reduces the problem of human errors, as big data can recognise abnormalittes in prescription of medication and flag them. This can be beneficial in reducing the possibilities of wrong medication or wrong dosages being prescribed. </p>
<p> The ability to collaborate huge amounts of data can also aid doctors in diagnosing patients, or preventing misdiagnosis. </p>

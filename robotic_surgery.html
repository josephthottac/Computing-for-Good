   <p> Robotic surgery or robot-assisted surgery is a minimally invasive surgery that integrates advanced computer technology.Â Here are the general steps to a Robotic-assisted surgery:
<ul> 
  <li>Your surgeon makes tiny (one to two centimeter-long) incisions in your body.</li>
  <li>Your doctor inserts a miniature robotic instruments and a powerful camera into your body</li>
  <li>Your surgeon then sits at a nearby console (a large computer) to direct the procedure. At the console, the area of operation can be seen highly magnified, with excellent resolution</li>
  <li>The instruments respond to these movements, and translate them into precise, real-time movements inside your body.</li>
  <li>The robotic devices, which have greater dexterity and range of motion than a human, allow your surgeon to successfully perform delicate surgeries in hard-to-reach places.</li>
</ul>
  <h2> What are the Benefits of Robotic-assisted Surgery? </h2>

<p> There are many benefits to having a Robotic-assisted surgery.
<ul> 
  <li>Your surgeon has greater range of motion and dexterity</li>
  <li>Your surgeon sees a highly-magnified, high-resolution image of the operating field</li>
  <li>Your surgeon has better access to the area being operated on</li>
  <li>Shorter hospital stay</li>
  <li>Less risk of infection</li>
  <li>Less blood loss and fewer blood transfusions</li>
  <li>Less pain</li>
  <li>Faster recovery</li>	
</ul>

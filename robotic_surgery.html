    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery">Robotic Surgery or robot-assisted surgery</a> is a minimally invasive surgery that integrates advanced computer technology. Robotic surgery are types of surgical procedures that are done using robotic systems. 
     Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to try to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally-invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.
     In the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to administer the instruments. 
     These include using a direct tele-manipulator or through computer control. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
     
     A tele-manipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery. 
     The robotic arms carry out those movements using end-effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery. 
     In computer-controlled systems, the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use tele-manipulators for their input. 
     One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery.
     Here are the general steps to a Robotic-assisted surgery:

 There are many <a href= "https://www.robotshop.com/community/blog/show/weighing-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-robotic-surgery">advantages and disadvantages</a> to having a Robotic-assisted surgery. Robotic surgery can be used for many types of surgeries, including prostate, gynecologic and cardiothoracic cases. 
  General surgeons are able to do gall bladder surgery, hernia surgery, cancer operations and colon surgery using a robot.
<ul> 
  
  <li>The nature of robotic surgery is less invasive, which means the patient experiences less pain and quicker recovery time. The surgical arms are often pneumatic, powered by compressed air and electricity to control the operation. The ‘hands’ of each arm, which hold each of the necessary surgical tools, are also smaller than human hands, which eliminates the need for large incisions. 
    The surgeon remains in the operating room throughout the procedure. A team of nurses also monitors the patient during the process.</li>
  <br>
   <li>Surgery is an expensive proposition at the best of times. The high cost of installing a robotic surgery system can increase the cost of a surgical procedure. 
    Surgical robots are costly to maintain, and their operation requires additional training, which is also expensive. Exact numbers are difficult to come by, but in general, a surgery utilising a da Vinci surgery robot will cost between $3,000 and $6,000 more than a traditional laparoscopic procedure. </li>
  <br> 
  <li>Some surgeries — from orthopaedic operations to neurological procedures — require a high degree of accuracy. One slip of the scalpel or misplaced set of forceps can cause damage or even result in the death of the patient. Robotic surgery robots aren't susceptible to the shaking or other strain-related movements a human surgeon might experience. 
    If the controller’s hands are shaking, the machine’s software compensates for that movement, so it doesn’t affect the surgery.Each robotic hand can rotate 360 degrees multiple times, something that human hands can’t do. This increases their range of motion. It is equipped with small joints that allow each arm to bend like a human wrist. This is an improvement over traditional laparoscopic tools, which are straight and unable to bend so they are harder to manipulate.  
    It is also equipped with a 3D high definition camera, providing a better view of the surgical site than would be available otherwise, even during open surgery.  </li>
  <br> 
  <li>One of the most significant problems with robotic surgery is the issue of latency — the time it takes for the robot to carry out the surgeon's commands. 
    It takes a few moments for the computer to communicate with the robotic arms. 
    While this isn't an issue for routine surgeries, it makes it difficult for surgeons to respond quickly to problems that occur during the operation.</li>
 <br> 
 <li>Surgeries, especially ones that take multiple hours, are exhausting for the attending surgeon. 
  The team is on their feet for hours at a time, completing the surgery and attending to the patient. 
  Surgery robots allow the surgeon to sit comfortably while operating.</li>

    <h4>Da Vinci Surgical System </h4> 


<img src= "https://media2.giphy.com/media/SIKp4VRG3aSEo/giphy.gif" alt="robotic surgery image 5" width=350 height=200 div style="float:right">
<br>
    <p>Robotic surgery with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System">Da Vinci Surgical System</a> was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. The technique has been rapidly adopted by hospitals in the United States and Europe for use in the treatment of a wide range of conditions.
The most widely used clinical robotic surgical system includes a camera arm and mechanical arms with surgical instruments attached to them. The surgeon controls the arms while seated at a computer console near the operating table. 
  The console gives the surgeon a high-definition, magnified, 3-D view of the surgical site. <br>
  Here is a short video of a grape stitched using the Da Vinci Surgical System 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHgeykDXFw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHgeykDXFw</a>
<br>
  <br>
  The surgeon leads other team members who assist during the operation.Da Vinci-S is the most advanced robot computer-assisted surgical system. 
  It has miniature instruments, which are operated on three separate arms. This gives a wide range of motion and high level of precision.
  It saves surrounding structures from damage. This precision also protects blood vessels from the trauma of the instruments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than 3 arms which are utilised for performing the surgery there is forth arm as well, which has a 3D camera and provides a magnified image to the surgeon.
This camera guides the surgeon about the operative field. The surgeon responsible for the surgery controls the instruments and camera from console present in the operation theatre.
All four arms of the robot can be used at a time by use of master control. The high definition monitor screen provides the surgeon 3D image of the insides of the human body. It’s obviously better than looking directly with our sight.

  <h5>
     Future of Robotic Surgery 
     </h5>
     <br>
  <p>
    Although robots have been approved by FDA for several procedures, they still face two types of challenges. One is the cost of the procedures and other is the dexterity.
    A lot of skill is required to learn to manipulate these robots for the surgeries. 
    It requires good training. These limitations are going to get improved in the near future with more trend. 
Robots which are available now are not sensors as the manual touch. There is a hope in the improvement of the technology of the sensors and the software.
Researchers also envision to merge robotic surgeries with the artificial intelligence and visual reality.This can support the idea of using these robots with brain waves. This can be a big revolutionary step.
There is another innovative idea of developing tiny robots called nano-robots, which can reach those surgical sites unapproachable by human hands.
    With the right expertise and technology, the advantages can eventually overcome the disadvantages. 
    Communication latency is currently the biggest hurdle to overcome to allow this technology to hold a more prominent place in the medical community. Even if the cost of the procedure slows down the integration in hospitals, surgeries with robotic machines will continue to become more commonplace, allowing more precise microsurgeries with improved accuracy.

   Even if the cost of the procedure slows down the integration in hospitals, surgeries with robotic machines will continue to become more commonplace, allowing more precise microsurgeries with improved accuracy.
New robotic technologies may produce cheaper systems and new developments such as haptic and tactile sensing and force feedback technology could potentially solve one of the real drawbacks of robotic surgery.
 Emergence of competitive companies may indeed contribute to tackling the high cost issue. Future developments aim to decrease variability of performance with an overall shortening of the learning curve.
 Indocyanine green, which can be used to identify vessel perfusion and differentiate tissue density, may be used in robotic surgery with the view to helping in intraoperative identification of vascular, neurological and oncological tissues 
To weigh out: The main attraction of robots is the high definition, three-dimensional camera which makes it easier to operate and shortens the learning curve compared to laparoscopy but robots are disadvantaged by the cost, lack of tactile feeling and longer operation time. 
If we consider that studies did not objectively demonstrate a significant benefit over laparoscopy, which somewhat contradicts the surgeons’ common sense and expectations, we cannot find an immediate or strong reason to think that robotic surgery, at the moment, will easily supersede laparoscopy.
 On the other hand, the developing technology might “purify” the robot of its disadvantages keeping or even improving its attractions. Furthermore, most of the studies do not provide level I evidence and that may change with improving the learning curve of the surgeons and the technology of the robots.
  Robots are a reality now and they cannot be simply dismissed without strong evidence. Like any new development, a sufficient period of trial and improvement has to be allowed before the final assessment conclusion can be drawn.

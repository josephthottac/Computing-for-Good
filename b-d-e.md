Really interesting content, showed well how CS can be used for positive impacts in medicine.
Nice design - minimal but works well. Like the use of images and gifs in the pages - makes more interesting.
English is great - reads very nicely. Strikes balance between being informative and nice to read.

In terms of balance of contributions, some did more than others:
14 commits by A-ntonia
12 commits by josephthottac
11 commits by dabecker1
6 commits by skcp42

Done somewhat at last minute but fine as still did lots of work throughout the week.

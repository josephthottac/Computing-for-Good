        <h2>What is the human genome?</h2>
        <p>The human genome is our complete set of DNA, including all of the genes. A genome contains all the information required to build a human, it is contained in the nucleus of every cell in the human body and contains around more than 3 billion base pairs of DNA.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col">
        <h2>How are Supercomputers used to sequence these genomes?</h2>
        <p>First, millions of complex images, stored on multiple petabytes worth of storage are loaded into the supercomputer where they are analysed in a parallel manner. Once each image has been analysed, mass statistical analysis is run to show which pairs are responsible for which part of the genome.
                Supercomputers have revolutionised this process by decreasing the cost of genome Sequencing from $3 billion in 2003 to less than $1000 today.

        <h2>Why is gene sequencing important? </h2>
        <p>Originally, it allowed scientists to finally understand what makes us human. Nowadays, it is important for many aspects of genetic research ranging from combatting genetic diseases to finding out evolutionary trends.</p>

          <h2>The human genome project (2003)</h2>
          <p>The Human Genome Project was initiated in 1990 and had the main goal of mapping the entire human genome. This would be revolutionary as previously, the human genome was mostly undiscovered and the known parts were from contributions from many different scientists. The initial motivation for the project was quite dubious as many scientists wanted to patent different genome sequences for profit. A rough draft of the genome was finished in 2000, this model was then refined until it was finally completed in 2003.</p>
          <h4>The technology behind gene sequencing</h4>
          <p>The reason the project took so long was because of the sheer amount of data that needed to be stored and processed, over the years, various discoverys in biology and advancements in computer science have allowed the speed and cost to reduce massively. For example, in 1986, a machine which cost $100,000 could process 12,000 "letters" of DNA per day whereas today, using the 454 technique (<a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-sequencing-technologies-690/" style="color:lightgray" target="_blank">read more here</a>), one billion bases can be processed in a day for far cheaper.</p>
